## About the Contest:
The **Spaghetti Code Contest** challenges participants to write the most **obfuscated** (difficult to read or understand) code possible while also finding and understanding the outputs of others’ codes. It’s a mix of creating complex problems and cracking codes.
Creating such complex code is a fun and creative challenge that tests our coding skills in a very unique way.

## Contributing:
Feel free to fork this repository, learn from the code, or use it as inspiration for your own obfuscated codes!
